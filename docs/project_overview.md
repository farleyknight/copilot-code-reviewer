# Project Overview: Copilot-Powered PR Reviewer VSCode Extension

The primary goal of this project is to develop a Visual Studio Code extension designed to streamline the code review process. This extension will integrate with version control systems (initially focusing on GitHub) to fetch Pull Request (PR) information and their associated diffs.

The core functionality will allow users to:
1.  Invoke a command (e.g., `@review`) within the VSCode environment.
2.  View a list of open PRs for the current repository.
3.  Select a specific PR for review.
4.  Bring the diff of the selected PR into the context of an AI assistant (referred to as "Copilot").5.  Utilize the AI assistant to analyze the diff, generate review comments, suggest improvements, and facilitate discussions around the PR's changes.

The extension aims to leverage AI capabilities to make code reviews more efficient, comprehensive, and insightful, directly within the developer's primary workspace.
